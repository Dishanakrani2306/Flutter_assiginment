Que 4. Difference between inheritance and encapsulation.
Ans.   Inheritance: 
             Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class to inherit properties and methods 
from another class. 
             It is used to create a hierachy of classes, where a subclass can inherit the attributes 
and behavior of its superclass.

       Encapsulation :
           Encapsulation is a mechanism that allows an object to hide its internal state and 
behavior from other objects. 
           It is used to protect the data of an object from being accessed or modified by other objects.

Que 5. Difference between inheritance and abstraction.
Ans.   Inheritance :
              Methodology of creating a new class using the properties and methods of an existing class.
              Helps to improve code resuability.
       abstraction :
              OOP concepts the hides the implementation details and shows only the functionalityto the user.
              Helps to reduce the complexity of the code.
       
Que 6. Difference between inheritance and polymorphism.
Ans.   Inheritance :
              Inheritance is one in which a new class is created that inherits the features from the already
existing class.
              It is basically applied to classes.
              It is used in pattern designing.
       Polymorphism :
             Whereas polymorphism is that which can be defined in multiple forms.
             Whereas it is basically applied to functions or methods.
             While it is also used in pattern designing.
